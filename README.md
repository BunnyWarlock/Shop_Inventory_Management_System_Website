I made this as a sole project for my CSE course. 

On this website, you have all the functionalities you need to run one or even multiple store warehouse. 

I have included the basic adding, editing, and removing items, along with a very responsive UI and a secured login system. The website warns you when an item is out of stock or below a certain threshold. You can easily search for an item and even look at their stats.

You can create your own store and become an admin. Then you can assign positions like manager or clerk to other users connected to your store.

You can also get a sales report.

Hopefully, you can learn and even implement this project on your own.

Thank you for reading.
